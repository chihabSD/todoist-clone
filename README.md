# Todoist-clone
This application is clone of (Todoist.com) was built using create-react-app as a base, a Firebase & React Testing Library. I'm hoping this gives people a better understanding of React. it also include Sass for styling and making it feel good.

I normally build the basic todo apps but I need something more interesting so I switched my attention todoist.com and I tried to clone it. Although this application is not 1005 like the original one but I used it to develop my web development skills.
